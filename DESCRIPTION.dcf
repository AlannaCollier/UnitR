Description: Provides tools for loading, cleaning, analysing, and visualising
seasonal climate data. The package includes functions to preprocess climate
datasets, compute seasonal statistics (e.g., mean, median), and visualise
trends interactively. It is designed for simplicity and efficiency,
incorporating advanced R features such as base R pipes, S3 methods, and robust
error handling. A default dataset, the Dublin Airport Climate Averages
(1981â€“2010), is used to demonstrate the package's capabilities.
